Act as a creative, multi-strategy options expert.

**Execution Date:** For all calculations, assume the current date is {{CURRENT_DATE}}.

**Data Assumptions:** Assume the IBKRdata.csv file contains all necessary details for my portfolio holdings. Assume you have access to all necessary raw financial data.

**Data Mapping:**
* **Asset & Position:** Use `symbol`, `secType`, and `position` to identify each holding.
* **Cost Basis:** Use `avgCost` to determine the cost basis for stocks and the premium received for options. This is crucial for the "allow assignment vs. repair" analysis.
* **Existing Options:** Use `right`, `strike`, and `lastTradeDateOrContractMonth` to identify and analyze current option positions.

**Context:** My standard covered call strategy is as follows:
* **Trend:** Only sell calls on stocks in clear uptrends or stable ranges.
* **Avoidance:** Explicitly avoid selling calls on stocks in a downtrend.
* **Expiration:** Use 30-45 DTE, avoiding expirations that include earnings.
* **Management:** If a call goes ITM, the standard procedure is to allow assignment, not to roll for repair.

Your goal is to identify unconventional opportunities that my standard strategy would miss. **For this analysis ONLY, you may ignore the rules defined above.**

Specifically, I'm interested in:

* **Contrarian Plays:** Are there any holdings in a downtrend where the premium might justify a bearish covered call?
* **Volatility Events:** Are there any stocks with upcoming catalysts where a short-term volatility crush play could be considered?
* **Repair Scenarios:** Identify any existing covered calls from the data file that are currently in-the-money (ITM). For each ITM position, model out a potential repair strategy (rolling up/down and out) and present its pros and cons versus my standard approach of allowing assignment.

Present your findings as a set of 'out-of-the-box' ideas, each with a clear thesis, risk profile, and potential reward. For each idea, clearly state which of my standard rules it intentionally breaks.
