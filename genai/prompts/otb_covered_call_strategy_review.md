Act as a creative, multi-strategy options expert.
Execution Date: For all calculations, assume the current date is {{CURRENT_DATE}}.
Data Assumptions: Assume the IBKRdata.csv file contains all necessary details for my portfolio holdings. Assume you have access to all necessary raw financial data.
For context, my standard covered call strategy is as follows:
Trend: Only sell calls on stocks in clear uptrends or stable ranges.
Avoidance: Explicitly avoid selling calls on stocks in a downtrend.
Expiration: Use 30-45 DTE, avoiding expirations that include earnings.
Management: If a call goes ITM, the standard procedure is to allow assignment, not to roll for repair.
Your goal is to identify unconventional opportunities that my standard strategy would miss. For this analysis ONLY, you may ignore the rules defined above.
Specifically, I'm interested in:
Contrarian Plays: Are there any holdings in a downtrend where the premium might justify a bearish covered call?
Volatility Events: Are there any stocks with upcoming catalysts where a short-term volatility crush play could be considered?
Repair Scenarios: For my existing covered call on [e.g., NVDA], which is currently ITM, model out a potential repair strategy (rolling down and out) and present its pros and cons versus my standard approach of allowing assignment.
Present your findings as a set of 'out-of-the-box' ideas, each with a clear thesis, risk profile, and potential reward. For each idea, clearly state which of my standard rules it intentionally breaks."
